					It gives me immense pleasure to introduce Fate Japanese Language Center Private Limited (FJLC) to students, guardians and prospective business associates. We are one of the leading education consultancies in Nepal, the land of Gautam Budhha and Mount Everest, especially promoting study in Japan. In a developing country like ours it is anything but natural that students empowered as they are with access to all sorts of technologies, want to see and experience what they are frequently exposed to. Abroad education, in particular, has gained the attention of lots of students who can foresee the difference that quality education, experience and exposure can bring in their lives. We stepped in the moment the trend was brewing up and turned it into a mutually beneficial business for us
					and the aspiring students.We started the institution in the midst of stiff competition but that only bolstered our hope and determination to create a space of our own, and we have been successful at that.{" "}

					After years of hard work and consistency, we are now a proud institution that has literally grown up on student trust and satisfaction. We have a proven track record of enrolling students in some of the best institutions in Japan. And we look forward to maintain the hard-earned legacy in the days to come. It gives us more reasons to rejoice for being able to establish our institution as a forerunner when it comes to study in Japan. We offer students a choice of thousands of courses at various leading educational institutions in Japan. We have been specially representing and promoting Japanese colleges and universities for abroad study for more than half a decade now. It is no wonder then that students take us as a credible institution when it comes to Japanese education. If you
					wish to apply for study abroad program, you can apply for universities and institutions in Japan which makes your dreams of studying abroad come true. Fate Japanese Language Center is committed to partnering with students, helping students which are offered by top-ranked educational institutions of Japan. The counsellors assist prospective students in obtaining the necessary documents prior to applying for admissions in the Japanese university or college. So, I wish you all the best for your bright future.
